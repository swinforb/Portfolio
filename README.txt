To run these programs you will first need to make sure that they are in the same directory along with the compatible .txt file of your choice.
Once this is done, you will have to type a series of commands into the terminal to compile and run them.

To compile the smallsh program use these commands:

gcc --stdu=gnu99 -o smallsh Smallsh2.c
